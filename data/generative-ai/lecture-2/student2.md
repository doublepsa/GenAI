# Lecture 2: Applied GenAI

## Why Notes?
- Make info retrievable
- Turn lecture into a usable system
- Summarize → remember better

---

## DIKW Pyramid
- Data: raw facts
- Information: data + context
- Knowledge: interpreted information
- Wisdom: applying knowledge

AI mostly operates at **information** level  
Goal: push toward **knowledge**

---

## Model Types
- Frontier models: most powerful
- Foundation models: general-purpose, adaptable

### Openness
- Closed-source
- Open-weight
- Fully open-source

Open models are catching up fast
