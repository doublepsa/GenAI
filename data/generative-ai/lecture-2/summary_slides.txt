**Introduction to Applied GenAI**
The presentation aims to demystify the ecosystem of Generative AI by exploring its history, core concepts, and practical tools for programmatic interaction.

**The DIKW Pyramid**
This conceptual framework illustrates how raw data is transformed through context and understanding into information, knowledge, and ultimately wisdom.

**History of Artificial Intelligence**
AI research originated in the 1950s with the Dartmouth Workshop and has evolved through distinct eras, from early logic-based systems to the current deep learning revolution.

**AI Hype Cycles**
The development of AI has historically oscillated between periods of high expectations and "AI winters," characterized by disillusionment and stagnation in funding and research.

**Symbolic vs. Subsymbolic AI**
The field is divided into symbolic AI, which uses logic-based approaches for problem-solving, and subsymbolic AI, which utilizes data-driven approaches for pattern recognition.

**Cognitive Architectures**
Kahneman’s distinction between fast, instinctive "System 1" thinking and slow, logical "System 2" thinking provides a useful analogy for understanding different AI processing modes.

**The Internet and Data**
The invention of the World Wide Web and TCP/IP protocols created the massive connectivity and data generation—often described as the "new oil"—necessary to train modern models.

**LLM Mechanics**
Large Language Models are fundamentally trained for autoregression, functioning as sophisticated autocomplete engines that predict the next token in a sequence.

**Frontier Model Providers**
The current landscape is dominated by major organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, who develop the most advanced "frontier" models pushing the boundaries of capability.

**Model Openness Taxonomy**
AI models are categorized by their level of transparency, ranging from fully closed proprietary systems to open-weight models and fully open-source projects that share training data and code.

**Open Source Performance**
Recent benchmarks indicate that open models capable of running on consumer hardware are rapidly closing the performance gap with proprietary frontier models.

**Training Compute and Energy**
The computational effort required to train state-of-the-art models has grown exponentially, leading to significant concerns regarding energy consumption and infrastructure demands.

**Data Scarcity**
Researchers project a potential bottleneck where the stock of high-quality human-generated public data may be fully utilized by the late 2020s.

**Levels of AI Intelligence**
The industry distinguishes between current narrow AI, human-level Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) which would surpass human capabilities across all domains.

**The Scaling Hypothesis**
This theory suggests that intelligence is an emergent property that arises naturally when simple neural units and learning algorithms are applied to massive datasets and compute resources.

**The Bitter Lesson**
Rich Sutton’s influential essay argues that general methods leveraging massive computation consistently outperform approaches that rely on human-encoded domain knowledge.

**Deployment Strategies**
Developers can choose to deploy LLMs through various tiers of infrastructure, ranging from managed AI-as-a-Service APIs to self-hosted bare-metal servers.

**Programmatic Interaction**
Interacting with LLMs involves sending HTTP requests via tools like cURL or utilizing programming languages, with Python serving as the backend standard and TypeScript for the frontend.

**Development Frameworks**
Libraries such as LangChain for application logic, LlamaIndex for data retrieval (RAG), and CrewAI for agent orchestration simplify the creation of complex AI applications.

**AI Assisted Development**
A new generation of tools including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf are transforming software engineering by acting as intelligent, AI-native pair programmers.

**Low Code Platforms**
Tools like Replit Agent and v0 allow users to generate web applications and user interfaces through natural language prompts, reducing the need for manual coding.

**Model Discovery and Platforms**
Hubs like Hugging Face serve as the central repository for open-source models, while aggregators like OpenRouter provide a unified API to access various proprietary and open models.

**Local AI Execution**
Tools such as Ollama enable developers to download and run powerful open-source large language models directly on local hardware without relying on cloud services.

**Personal Knowledge Management**
The presentation concludes by highlighting methodologies and tools like Obsidian and Notion that help individuals collect, connect, and synthesize information to enhance learning and productivity.
